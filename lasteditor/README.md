# lasteditor README

This is the README for our extension "lasteditor".
This will keep a record of all the functioning and usage of the extension.

## Features

1. The main feature of this extension is to display the name of the last editor of each line of a code.
2. It uses the Git Blame command to read and extract content from the git database.
3. With the latest version, the name of the last editor of the selected line of code is displayed on the leftmost corner of the line, in red colour.

<u>For example:</u> I've attached 2 screenshots, diplaying the names of the authors of the code.
